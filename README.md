Written as kind of an April Fools Day gag for work when I was working on F-35 Pilot Training Devices at Lockheed.

I've done most of my testing on firefox and so that's where it looks best but it should work on IE, chrome, safari, etc.

Controls
--------
-  left/right/up/down:  arrow keys
-  fire: spacebar

TODOs
-----
-  The game is pretty short, needs more content
-  The image assets are really too hi-res for the pixel art look I was going for.
-  add sound effects/music
